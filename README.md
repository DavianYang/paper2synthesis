# Overview

It’s crucial for lawmakers, regulators, and policymakers to base climate decisions on scientific evidence and to assess current climate policies through the lens of this evidence. Evaluating climate policies helps improve regulations, fosters transparency, and builds public trust. It also motivates both public and private sectors to make commitments and take stronger actions.

Academic research offers valuable insights for climate policy evaluation. With the vast amount of scientific studies available, it's important to systematically review and summarize the current scientific understanding. The first step in this process is to identify the most relevant studies for specific policies.

In this notebook, I'll demonstrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to identify and map climate-related research using a supervised learning approach.

Here’s the structure of the notebook:
1. First, I’ll explore the dataset and create a basic machine learning pipeline.
2. Next, I’ll train a more advanced model using a supervised SVM classifier.
3. Finally, I’ll train and evaluate pretrained transformer models.
